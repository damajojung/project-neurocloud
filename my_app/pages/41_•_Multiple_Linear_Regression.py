If we were dealing with only 3 variables, let's say the first three, we can plot this data nicely. However, if you are dealing with more than three values, 
one has to use a visualisation
and check, which variables make sense to take into consideration. Moreover, the data in 3D-Plots can sometimes be a bit tricky to grasp. Therefore,
it is advisable to stick to 2D-plots which can be seen in the following figure where each variable of the data set is plotted against another one.

It is clearly visible that Sealevel, Height and Leaf Size share a linear relationship. Therefore, it makes sense to use them. Magnesium seems to be more of a
random nature and caesium has clearly not a linear relationship with most other variables. As we can see, this is a fast way one can 
visualise and check the relationships of several variables. However, if you are dealing with hundrets
of variables, one has to use a faster way to determine which variables are worthwhile using and which ones are not.
