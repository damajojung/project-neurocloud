Unsupervised machine learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that involves training a model on an unlabeled dataset to identify 
patterns or relationships within the data without being given explicit output variables. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does 
not require labeled data, and the goal is to discover the underlying structure of the data.

The process of unsupervised learning typically involves the following steps:

* Data collection: Collect an unlabeled dataset that includes input variables.
* Data preprocessing: Clean, normalize, and transform the data to prepare it for modeling.
* Model selection: Select a suitable model architecture and algorithm to analyze the dataset.
* Training: Train the model on the unlabeled dataset to identify patterns or relationships within the data.
* Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model based on domain-specific criteria, such as cluster coherence or dimensionality reduction.

Unsupervised learning can be used for a wide range of applications, such as clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction. Clustering 
is a common application of unsupervised learning, where the goal is to group similar data points together into clusters based on their similarities
 or distances in the feature space. Anomaly detection, on the other hand, involves identifying data points that deviate significantly from the 
 expected patterns or distributions within the data. Dimensionality reduction involves transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional
   space while preserving its important features and relationships. The success of unsupervised learning depends on the quality and quantity of 
   the input data and the selection of appropriate model architecture and hyperparameters.
