This topic is being discussed in section **ðŸ§  Deep Learning**. However, I would like to emphasize that neural networks are a part of the supervised machine
learning world. Since it is such a broad topic with various aspects to look at, I would like to dedicate a whole section on it's own for them. But first, 
let's quickly take a look at unsupervices learning techniques.
